# parKing Description
This is a web app which schedules drivers, cars, and parking spots.  This also allows for keeping track of violations.

## Work Flow
The main page is filled with links which contact the MySQL database via PHP and perform actions.  I have HTML form elements for transfering information to a PHP script which writes the actual query to the database.

-  HTML Form gathers information via input tags with the name property
-  Submitting the form via the POST method and action PHP script runs on the server
-  Action PHP script constructs query or database operation to be executed.
-  New information can be retreived and processed and displayed.
-  There should be navigation links to send you to other areas of the web app to complete other tasks.
